# 🌍 Regional Vaccination System - Country-Specific Schedules

## 🎯 **Overview**

The Regional Vaccination System automatically adapts vaccination schedules based on the farmer's location, ensuring compliance with local veterinary practices, disease patterns, and regulatory requirements. Each country has unique vaccination protocols based on endemic diseases, climate, and government regulations.

## 🗺️ **How Regional Detection Works**

### **Automatic Location Detection Priority:**
1. **User's saved preference** - Manually selected region/country
2. **IP-based geolocation** - Automatic detection from internet connection
3. **Browser language settings** - Fallback based on device language
4. **Global default** - Universal vaccination schedule as last resort

### **Example Detection Flow:**
```javascript
// User in India
Location: Mumbai, India (IP: 203.192.xxx.xxx)
→ Region: south_asia
→ Country: IN
→ Vaccination Schedule: India-specific cattle vaccines

// User in Brazil  
Location: São Paulo, Brazil (IP: 177.43.xxx.xxx)
→ Region: latin_america
→ Country: BR
→ Vaccination Schedule: Brazil-specific cattle vaccines
```

- BVD: Discontinued (not endemic in region)
```

### **Schedule Reconciliation Process:**
1. **Detect location change** (manual or automatic)
2. **Get new regional schedule** for each animal type
3. **Compare existing vs. new requirements**
4. **Update pending vaccinations** to match new schedule
5. **Add new required vaccinations** not in old schedule
6. **Remove obsolete vaccinations** not needed in new region
7. **Send notifications** about schedule changes
