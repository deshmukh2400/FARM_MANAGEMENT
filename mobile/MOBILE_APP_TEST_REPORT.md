4. **Add analytics** (Firebase Analytics)
5. **Performance optimization** (React.memo, useMemo)

#### **Short Term (Post-Launch)**
1. **Offline functionality** with local storage
2. **Push notifications** implementation
3. **Biometric authentication** (Face ID/Touch ID)
4. **Dark mode** support
5. **Internationalization** (i18n)

#### **Long Term (Future Releases)**
1. **TypeScript migration** for better type safety
2. **Advanced animations** (Reanimated 3)
3. **Camera ML integration** for animal recognition
4. **IoT device integration**
5. **Advanced reporting** and analytics
