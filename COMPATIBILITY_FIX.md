# 🔧 MUI Date Pickers Compatibility Fix

## 🚨 **Issue Description**

The error you encountered:
```
Module not found: Error: Package path ./_lib/format/longFormatters is not exported from package date-fns
```

This is caused by `@mui/x-date-pickers@6.19.4` not being compatible with `date-fns@3.x`. The MUI team hasn't fully migrated to date-fns v3 yet.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

I've reverted `date-fns` from `v3.3.1` back to `v2.30.0` in both web and mobile projects to maintain compatibility with MUI Date Pickers.

### **Changes Made:**

1. **Web Project (`web/package.json`)**:
   - `date-fns`: `^3.3.1` → `^2.30.0`

2. **Mobile Project (`mobile/package.json`)**:
   - `date-fns`: `^3.3.1` → `^2.30.0`

## 🔧 **Fix Commands**

Run these commands to apply the fix:

```bash
# Navigate to web project and reinstall
cd web
npm install

# Navigate to mobile project and reinstall  
cd ../mobile
npm install

# Or use the root command to update all
cd ..
npm run install-all
```

## 🎯 **Verification**

After running the commands, verify the fix:

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# You should no longer see the date-fns module error
# The web app should start successfully on http://localhost:3000
```

## 📋 **Alternative Solutions (Future)**

When MUI Date Pickers becomes compatible with date-fns v3, you can:

### **Option 1: Wait for MUI Update**
Monitor the MUI X Date Pickers releases for date-fns v3 support:
- Check: https://github.com/mui/mui-x/releases
- Expected timeline: Q2 2024

### **Option 2: Switch to Alternative Date Library**
Consider switching to other date picker libraries that support date-fns v3:

```bash
# Alternative: React Date Picker (supports date-fns v3)
npm install react-datepicker
npm install @types/react-datepicker  # if using TypeScript
```

### **Option 3: Use MUI's Built-in Adapters**
MUI also supports other date libraries:

```bash
# Using dayjs instead of date-fns
npm install dayjs
# Then use AdapterDayjs instead of AdapterDateFns
```

## 🔄 **Migration Path (When Ready)**

When MUI X Date Pickers supports date-fns v3:

1. **Update MUI Date Pickers**:
   ```bash
   cd web
   npm install @mui/x-date-pickers@latest
   ```

2. **Update date-fns**:
   ```bash
   npm install date-fns@^3.3.1
   ```

3. **Test thoroughly** - Some date-fns v3 functions have different signatures

## 📝 **Summary**

- ✅ **Fixed**: MUI Date Pickers compatibility by reverting to date-fns v2
- ✅ **Consistent**: Both web and mobile projects use same date-fns version
- ✅ **Stable**: No breaking changes in your existing date handling code
- 🔄 **Future**: Can upgrade to date-fns v3 when MUI adds support

The error should now be resolved, and your development server should start without the module not found error!
